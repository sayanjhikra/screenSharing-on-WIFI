# screenSharing-on-WIFI

Screen sharing on WiFi refers to the capability of wirelessly transmitting the contents of a device's screen, such as a computer, tablet, or smartphone, to another display or device within the same local network at real-time. This functionality is particularly useful in various contexts, ranging from business presentations to collaborative work environments and educational settings.

In educational settings, screen sharing on WiFi facilitates interactive learning experiences. Teachers and presenters can share educational content, demonstrations, or interactive applications with students on a larger screen, creating an engaging and immersive learning environment.
